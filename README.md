# fcc-landing-page
Another landing page project which was created as a part of freeCodeCamp's course (New) Responsive Web Design.

This is a page about a fictional company called Bigger by Science (yes, inspired by Stronger by Science) which provides users
with training programmes for hypertrophy (muscle growth). 

## Colors
I used four primary colors for this project:

1. Iceberg color #84ACCE
2. Steel Blue color #537999
3. Oxford Blue color #0B2545
4. Orange color #FF8018

## My experience with this project
The more I'm going through freeCodeCamp's curriculum, the more things click inside of my head. Now I finally understand why people should use properties such as max-width, min-width, flex, flex-grow, flex-basis, flex-shrink and media queries, which are amazing.
